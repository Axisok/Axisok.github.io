	"about-greet": "Hello!",
	"about-intro": "My name is Diogo Yoshiura Moreira (Axisok in most places), I've been writing code in my free time for over a decade now, and probably will continue for the next one. I've wanted to develop games ever since I was a kid, and for the last 4 years, used Unity to do it.",
	"about-projects": "Over the years, I've made some projects that I'm somewhat proud of, which I'll show on this website. These projects aren't necessarily games (and at the time of writing, none of them are), but just projects I've made for no particular reason, other than having fun. I also plan to offer (sometimes for free) some assets I'm working on, which will also be found here.",
	"about-wip": "Currently, this website is still a work in progress, and I don't have that many projects worth showcasing, either. Hopefully it'll have more stuff at some point in the future!",

	"about-more": "More from me",
	"about-youtube": "If you want to find some of the other things I've done and will do, you can check out my personal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Axisok\">YouTube channel</a>. Most videos there are random gaming things, especially in the past year. I'm considering opening a second channel for more serious content (as opposed to random things I just wanted to post), but I'm not sure if I'm ready for the time investment just yet.",
	"about-github": "You can also check my <a href=\"https://github.com/Axisok\">GitHub profile</a>, but there isn't much to find there, unfortunately. I don't have the habit of making a repository for every single project of mine, and I'm definitely not maintaining any of the ones that are there. Still, I'm hoping to fill it a bit more in the future, as I already have a few projects in mind (he says, after not having basically any activity for months after this website was originally created).",
	"about-contact": "For any questions, feel free to contact me through axisokk@gmail.com. I don't promise to answer quickly or at all, but I'll do my best.",

	"projects-quadtree-title": "QuadTree Compression for ComputerCraft Videos",
	"projects-quadtree-brief": "A compression algorithm that converts and reduces the size of a video file very efficiently. Made for a Minecraft mod that adds computers to the game, only supports binary videos (only 2 colors).",
	"projects-quadtree-why": "ComputerCraft, the mod in question, has a limit of 1 MB total size storage per computer in-game. Naively storing pixels directly to bytes would be extremely wasteful, and even storing each pixel as a bit would still be very wasteful. And for this resolution, there's simply not enough redundancy for most generic compression algorithms to work well.",
	"projects-quadtree-detail": "However, by seeing each frame as a quadtree structure and storing it in the shortest way possible, it's possible to considerably reduce file size. This is overkill for most use cases, and binary videos won't have enough colors most of the time, which is why this method isn't good for many situations. Still, it's a very efficient way to store videos for this one situation.",
	"projects-quadtree-link": "This project is open-source and can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Axisok/qtccv\">here</a>.",

	"projects-shaped-title": "Shaped Clouds",
	"projects-shaped-brief": "A fast dynamic clouds system, capable of rendering clouds of any shape and form. Generates 2D noise based on textures then renders that, or anything else, as clouds; using more detailed noise. Meshes can be rendered as clouds, as well as any custom shaders and renderers. Basically anything that can render to a camera can render as a cloud.",
	"projects-shaped-link": "I've been working on this for a very long time, so long that it's unrecognizable from when it started. After rewriting all the code several times, beating my head around how to make it work on multiple Unity versions and a lot of bug hunting, I decided to make it an asset and try to sell it. It's available <a href=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/297113\">here</a>.",

	"404-title": "Oops!",
	"404-para": "Sorry! I have absolutely no idea about where the page you're looking for is. If you think that's a mistake on my part, please do contact me about it so I can come fix it up!"
