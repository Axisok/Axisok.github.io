			<h1 data-i18n-key="about-greet">Hello!</h1>
			<p data-i18n-key="about-intro">My name is Diogo Yoshiura Moreira (Axisok in most places), I've been writing code in my free time for over a decade now, and probably will continue for the next one.
				I've wanted to develop games ever since I was a kid, and for the last 4 years, used Unity to do it.
			</p>
			<p data-i18n-key="about-projects">Over the years, I've made some projects that I'm somewhat proud of, which I'll show on this website.
				These projects aren't necessarily games (and at the time of writing, none of them are), but just projects I've made for no particular reason, other than having fun.
				I also plan to offer (sometimes for free) some assets I'm working on, which will also be found here.
			</p>
			<p data-i18n-key="about-wip">Currently, this website is still a work in progress, and I don't have that many projects worth showcasing, either.
				Hopefully it'll have more stuff at some point in the future!
			</p>

			<p data-i18n-key="about-youtube">If you want to find some of the other things I've done and will do, you can check out my personal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Axisok">YouTube channel</a>.
				Most videos there are random gaming things, especially in the past year.
				But it also contains a few test videos I decided to share with the world, in case anyone is interested to see them.
			</p>
			<p data-i18n-key="about-github">You can also check my <a href="https://github.com/Axisok">GitHub profile</a>, but there isn't much to find there, unfortunately.
				I don't have the habit of making a repository for every single project of mine, and I'm definitely not maintaining any of the ones that are there.
				Still, I'm hoping to fill it a bit more in the future, as I already have a few projects in mind.
			</p>
			<p data-i18n-key="about-contact">For any questions, feel free to contact me through axisokk@gmail.com.
				I don't promise to answer quickly or at all, but I'll do my best.
