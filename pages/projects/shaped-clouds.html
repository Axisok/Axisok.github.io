			<h1 data-i18n-key="projects-shaped-title">Shaped Clouds</h1>
			<p data-i18n-key="projects-shaped-brief">A fast dynamic clouds system, capable of rendering clouds of any shape and form.
				Generates 2D noise based on textures, then renders that, or anything else, as clouds, using more detailed noise.
				Meshes can be rendered as clouds, as well as any custom shaders and renderers.
				Basically anything that can render to a camera can render as a cloud.
			</p>
			<p data-i18n-key="projects-shaped-link">I've been working on this for a very long time, so long that it's unrecognizable from when it started.
				After rewriting all the code several times, beating my head around how to make it work on multiple Unity versions and a lot of bug hunting, I decided to make it an asset and try to sell it.
				It's available <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/297113">here</a>.

			<h1 data-i18n-key="shaped-goal-title">Goal</h1>
			<p data-i18n-key="shaped-goal-intro">The main goal of this system is performance without compromising too much on quality.
				Of course, some degree of sacrifice is inevitable, and that takes the form of it being a 2D effect.
				In other words, these clouds don't occupy real space in the world, and can't cast/receive shadows.
				This is something a volumetric clouds system would be able to achieve, but at a great cost in performance.
			</p>
			<p data-i18n-key="shaped-goal-case">For a vast majority of games, having super accurate clouds or being able to fly through them is simply not a factor.
				The speed of this system means it provides a middle ground between just scrolling some textures on the sky and using volumetric, accurate clouds.
				There's no reason to use a volumetric clouds solution if the only benefit is realistic clouds.
				In addition, the key feature of these clouds is that they can be shaped in any way the user wants to.
				This is, in fact, more customization than most volumetric systems can provide, especially considering the performance it achieves in comparison.
